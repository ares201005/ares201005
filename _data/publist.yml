  image: JCTC2024_ml.jpeg
  description: This work presents a general protocol to predict excited-state properties, such as energies, transition dipoles, and nonadiabatic coupling vectors with the hierarchically interacting particle neural network. ML predictions are then applied to compute the potential energy surfaces and electronic spectra of a prototype azomethane molecule in the collective coupling scenario. These computational tools provide a much-needed framework to model and understand many molecules’ emerging excited-state polariton chemistry

- title: "Quantum Simulation of Molecular Response Properties in the NISQ Era"
  image: JCTC2023_QLR.jpeg
  description: In this work,  we develop a quantum linear response (qLR) theory to calculate molecular response properties on near-term quantum computers. Inspired by the recently developed variants of the quantum counterpart of equation of motion (qEOM) theory, the qLR formalism employs “killer condition” satisfying excitation operator manifolds that offer a number of theoretical advantages along with reduced quantum resource requirements. We also used the qEOM framework in this work to calculate the state-specific response properties.

- title: "Theory and modeling of light-matter interactions in chemistry: current and future"
  image: pccp2023_toc.jpeg 
  description: This perspective starts with the basic background of light-matter interactions, molecular quantum electrodynamics theory, and the challenges of modeling light-matter interactions in chemistry. Then, the recent advances in modeling plasmon and polariton chemistry are described, and future directions toward multiscale simulations of light–matter interaction-mediated chemistry are discussed.

- title: "Theory and modeling of light-matter interactions in chemistry: current and future"
  image: pccp2023_toc.jpeg 
  description: This perspective starts with the basic background of light-matter interactions, molecular quantum electrodynamics theory, and the challenges of modeling light-matter interactions in chemistry. Then, the recent advances in modeling plasmon and polariton chemistry are described, and future directions toward multiscale simulations of lightâ€“matter interaction-mediated chemistry are discussed.

  description: ClusterVQE therefore allows exact simulation of the problem by using fewer qubits and shallower circuit depth at the cost of additional classical resources, making it a potential leader for quantum chemistry simulations on NISQ.

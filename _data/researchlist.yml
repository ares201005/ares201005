  description: Quantum computers were proposed to be a game changer for chemistry and materials science modeling, but the tools are yet to be developed. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are the current state-of-the-art in the noisy intermediate-state quantum (NISQ) era. Existing advances such as variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) solvers need quality initial states (ansatzes) and a minimal number of qubits for each the problem at hand (currently limited to very small molecules only). Subsequently, casting the original problems in terms of novel quantum algorithms and software layers is a key ingredient for solving the quantum problem and demonstrating the practical utility of existing QC hardware. Our particular innovation is the development of algorithms able to achieve the qubit size reduction for quantum solver methods based on Quantum Graph Partitioning. In particular, we develop 1) Strategies and algorithms to perform static quantum chemistry calculations on medium-to-large size molecules on QCs; 2) Quantum molecular dynamics on QCs; 3) Krylov subspace algorithms for excited states and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
